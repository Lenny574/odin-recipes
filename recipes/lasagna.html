    <li>1 large egg <em>beaten</em></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Preheat the oven to 350F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</p> 
      <p>Add the lasagna noodles and cook until al dente (firm) according to package</p>
      <p>directions. Drain, rinse under cold water, and set aside.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or Dutch oven, brown the beef, sausage, onion,</p>
      <p>and garlic over medium-high heat until no pin remains. Drain the fat.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Stir in the pasta sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, 1.2 teaspoon of salt, and</p>
      <p>1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. Simmer uncovered over medium heat for 5</p>
      <p>minutes or until slightly thickened. Tast and season with additional salt if</p>
      <p>desired.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>In a separate medium bowl, combine 1-1.2 cups mozzarella cheese, 1/4 cup</p>
      <p>parmesan cheese, ricotta, parsley, egg, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9x13 pan or casserole dish. Top it with 3</p>
      <p>lasagna noodles. Layer with 1 cup of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup of</p>
      <p>meat sauce. Repeat twice more. Finish with 3 noodles topped with remaining</p>
      <p>sauce.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Remove the foil and sprinkle the top of the lasagna with the remaining</p>
      <p>mozzarella cheese adn parmesan cheese. Make uncovered for an additional 15</p>
      <p>minutes or until browned and bubble. Broil for 2-3 minutes if desired.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p><strong>*Note on the sauce:</strong> In this recipe, each layer has about 1 cup of meat sauce. If</p>
    <p>you prefer more sauce in you lasagna, increase the pasta sauce to 45oz, Salt</p>
    <p>needed may vary based on the brand of pasta sauce used. Taste and season after</p>
    <p>simmering.</p>
    <p><strong>Cheese Layer: </strong>The cheese layers are thin; if you'd prefer a thicker layers cheese,</p>
    <p>divide the cheese in half and put on the first two layers, and add just meat sauce</p>
    <p>to the third layer. We tested this with extra ricotta cheese and found it</p>
    <p>overpowered the lasagna.</p>
    <p><strong>Time-Saving Tip: </strong>Use fresh lasagna sheets found in the deli area adn skip the</p>
    <p>boiling step! Fresh lasagna doesn't need to be boiled first.</p>
    <p>Let the lasagna sit/rest for at least 15 minutes once removed from the oven (even</p>
    <p>30-45 minutes is fine). This will keep it from becoming runny and help it to keep its</p>
    <p>shapre when cut. Resting is not required when reheating.</p>
    <p>Subsitutions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Ricotta cheese can be replaced with cottage cheese.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Use all beef (or even ground turkey) in place of sausage if needed. If using all</p>
        <p>beef, add 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning to the mead (and 1.4 teaspoon fennel seeds</p>
        <p>if desired).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
